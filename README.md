# Jupyter Notebooks Collection

My Python Notebooks Collection from Kaggle competitions and different topics I dive into.

1. **Graphs Exploration** (**_Algos.ipynb_**): University assignment for _Algorithms & Data Structures_ about finding semi - optimal solutions for the _k-centers problem_ in a graph, following both a greedy & a brute-force approach
2. **Stock Market** (**_Stock Market.ipynb_**) : Stock Market analysis using past data for S&P 500 companies for open, close prices etc
